# SwipeIsh-iOS-game-
(In Progress) iOS game based on the handgame "Ish"

*THIS REPOSITORY WILL ONLY SHOW CERTAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE APP, NOT EVERYTHING NEEDED TO CODE THE FULL APP

This app requires two people to play on the same device (one player on each end of the phone length-wise)

The app has a timer feature that displays image assets between each count for a visual for users to know when to swipe (timer can be turned off).

Inputs two swipe gestures and displays the image asset of what swipe direction (up, down, left, right) each user swiped.
The app also features a settings page to adjust timer speed, audio settings, and (in the future) color settings for each swipe field
